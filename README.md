# To run your react native application

to open in expo go
Npm start
Or
Npx expo go

Gotcha:
You must be on the same network for both devices

In Android Studio
Open android Studio
(Small type in the middle of the page) -> More Actions -> Virtual Device Manager
Choose the device already created or “Create Device”
Choose “play” button.

Go to VS Code
Type “npn run android”
Note — on 3/28/23 I haven’t gotten this to work much. It seems more touchy than the expo emulator.
